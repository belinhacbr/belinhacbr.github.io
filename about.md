<p>There's nothing here but in case you felt the need to find something, here's a meaningless banana: üçå</p>
  





<p>In case you are unsatisfied with the lack of meaning, don't worry, I got you covered.</p>







<p>It is, in fact, a banana that grew on the left earlobe of Artemis, the Goddess of the hunt. According to the legend, the banana poped out to life when she accidentally sneezed while practicing shooting with her bow at wild beasts.</p>


<p>Have a nice and meaningful day!</p>
